# Travelling Salesman Problem 
Travelling Salesman Problem solved using Genetic Algorithm.
Working Plan:

-populate x
-check fit x
-add an additonal array for the nextGeneration x
-regular mutation (0.2) x
-inverse mutation (0.2) x
-crossover (0.4) x
-reproduce(copy) (0.2) x
-copy from nextGen array to chromemx (loop) x
-loop n times x
-result is a last generation created with calculated fitness of each route and the overall best route x
